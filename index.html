                Web Developer with over 6 years of independent game development experience specialized in object oriented programming language, Lua. Game development taught me to become adept in focusing on aesthetics, efficiency, performance, as well as paying close attention to details. Initially, I intended on adding web development to my repertoire to enhance project management and user interactions within my games.

                After immersing myself in web development I realized I wanted to do it as a career.  I completed the University of Central Florida Coding Bootcamp where I gained an exceptional understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as a strong comprehension in the libraries/frameworks of Bootstrap and JQuery.                 </p>
